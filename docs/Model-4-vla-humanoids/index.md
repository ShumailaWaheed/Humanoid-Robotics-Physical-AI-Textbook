# Humanoid Robotics – Vision, Locomotion & AI

## Module Overview
This module focuses on **humanoid robotics**, emphasizing vision, locomotion, and AI-driven control. You will explore how humanoids perceive their environment, move dynamically, and interact safely with humans and objects. Simulation and AI techniques enable you to test complex behaviors before deploying to physical robots.

## Why Humanoid Robotics?
- **Human-like mobility**: Understand walking, balancing, and complex movements  
- **Perception & AI**: Combine vision, sensors, and decision-making  
- **Safe experimentation**: Test in simulation to reduce risk and cost  
- **Capstone relevance**: Supports advanced robotics projects

## Module Structure

### Week 11: Humanoid Kinematics & Dynamics
- Study joint configurations and kinematic chains  
- Forward and inverse kinematics  
- Dynamics for balance and motion planning  

### Week 12: Locomotion & Balance Control
- Walking gait generation  
- Dynamic balance and fall recovery  
- Real-time control algorithms  

### Week 13: Vision, Perception & AI
- Integrate cameras and depth sensors  
- Object recognition and semantic mapping  
- AI-based decision making and control  
- Simulation to real-world transfer

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this module, students will be able to:

✅ Implement humanoid kinematics and dynamic control  
✅ Generate stable walking gaits and perform balance recovery  
✅ Integrate vision and perception systems into humanoid control  
✅ Test AI-driven humanoid behaviors in simulation  
✅ Develop end-to-end workflows for autonomous humanoid systems  

## Capstone Integration
Humanoid skills developed in this module are critical for your capstone project:

1. **Locomotion testing** in simulation ensures safe real-world walking  
2. **Vision-based tasks** allow humanoids to navigate and interact  
3. **AI integration** enables decision-making in complex environments  

## Practical Tips
- Start with **simulation first**, then gradually move to hardware  
- Use **incremental testing** to avoid robot damage  
- Optimize **sensor fusion** for real-time perception  
- Keep **modular code design** for locomotion and vision algorithms
